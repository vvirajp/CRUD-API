# Hexon-API

CRUD based small API using node.js, express framework, and Postgres as the database.The API endpoints are secured using JSONWebToken (JWT). I have also included the .sql file in order to create Database and Tables in postgreSQL.
<br />

The Database has four tables - 

1- drivers <br />
2- vehicles <br />
3- routes <br />
4- trips <br />
